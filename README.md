slideToolkit: an assistive toolset for the histological quantification
of whole slide images

The demand for accurate and reproducible phenotyping of a disease trait
increases with the rising number of biobanks and genome wide association
studies. Detailed histological analysis is a powerful way of phenotyping
human tissues. However, purely visual histological assessment is time
consuming and liable to sampling variation and optical illusions and
thereby observer variation, and external validation may be cumbersome.

Therefore, computerized quantification of digitized histological slides
is often preferred as a more precise and reproducible, and sometimes
more sensitive approach. Relatively few free toolkits are however
available for fully digitized microscopic slides, usually known as whole
slides images (WSI).

In order to comply with this need, we developed the slideToolkit as a
fast method to handle large quantities of low contrast whole slides
images using advanced cell detecting algorithms. The slideToolkit has
been developed for modern personal computers and high performance
clusters (HPCs) and is available as an opensource project on github.com.

In conclusion, slideToolkit provides a free, powerful and versatile
collection of tools for automated feature analysis of whole slide images
to create reproducible and meaningful phenotypic datasets.

Release early, release often.
