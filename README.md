slideToolkit
============

slideToolkit: an assistive toolset for the histological quantification
of whole virtual slides

The demand of reliable and reproducible quantification of large numbers
of histological slides increases with the rising number of biobanks. For
research purposes, manual assessment of histological slides is time
consuming and the reproducibility is moderate. Therefor reproducible
computerized quantification of digitized virtual histological slides is
preferred, especially when used for association with genetic data.

We developed the slideToolkit; a reproducible and reliable method to
analyze and quantify large quantities of immunohistochemically stained
virtual slides. The slideToolkit is available as a project on github.com
and depends on open source software only. The slideToolkit is build for
*nix based modern personal computers and high performance clusters
(HPCs)

A slideToolkit workflow consists of four consecutive steps. In the first
step, “acquisition”, virtual slides are collected converted to .tiff
files. In the second step, “preparation”, files are organized. The third
step, “tiles”, creates multiple manageable tiles to count. The fourth
step, “analyze”, tissue is analyzed and results are stored in a dataset.

The slideToolkit as a reliable way to convert digital virtual slide into
a dataset you can use for further analysis.
