Ubuntu 12.04 ‐ slideToolkit installation instructions
-----------------------------------------------------

Here are the installation instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 [LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).
Ubuntu 12.04 is probably the most documented and most supported version
of Linux available today. I tried to create as few steps as possible
with one‐liners that are *easy* to read. Commands can span over multiple
lines. You can copy/paste commands. Oh, and the double ampersand, `&&`,
means 'if previous was successful, continue with the next'. And yes, all
steps run in the Terminal.

```bash
these `mono‐type font` illustrate commands illustrate terminal commands. You can copy & paste these.
